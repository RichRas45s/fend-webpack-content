Hello Udacity, this is my NLP PROJECT submission
I have been working on this quite extensively. 
Please review... 

1. Installed  Node Version Manager NVM via Homebrew 

2. Using Node 14  & webpack 4 

3. I start with  ' source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh '  on command line 
after reviewing some error codes on compatibilty and
dependencies issues this worked for me, 

4. I have been working  from the Udacity lessons files because I sorted out 
all dependencies in this project. 

5. Installed Environment Varible

6. Installed Jest

7. Created _test_ Folder has (2) test functions


8. Installed Service Workers 

extra
  I looked up validating A URL USING REGEX and implemented /replaced name checker function
  to check the URL validity using the same/single input line.
