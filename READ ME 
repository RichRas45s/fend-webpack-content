This is my submission to try to help fix a problem I'm having 
hiding my api Key using .env  process.env in the formhandler.js file. 

I start with  ' source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh '  on command line 
I'm not sure why but after reviewing some error codes on compatibilty and
dependencies  issues this worked for me, 


Using Node 14  & webpack 4

just have been working  from the lessons files because i sorted out 
all dependencies in this project. 

Installed service workers , jest 


installed Environment Plugin
